# November Hangout Topics

Original doodle poll was: https://doodle.com/poll/byinp3453qdm3chp

When? Wednesday, 6th of November 2019, 20:00 UTC+1.

Meeting Link: https://whereby.com/rebaze

There are quite some reasons to have a call again:
- very long time since the last hangout (July if i remember correctly)
- many new people arrived
- the OSGi community event has taken place

## Propsal for agenda (total time hopefully around 60mins)

1. Quick introduction round
2. Initial GreenDev question asked was, here in german: "OSGi, is das noch frisch, oder kann das Weg"? - loosly translated as "OSGi: is this still fresh or can it go to trash?"
3. If someone is attending this call who has some "Flurfunk" from Eclipsecon/OSGiCon to share.. step up! ;)
4. OSGi = best way to create modular monoliths (create and push this category, other than the microservices category)
5. There has been some activity outside of OSGi Specs recently. Maybe we can quickly pitch one or two for inspiration?
- JBs Whinegrower
- Tonis Febo/Golemites
6. There where older ideas that we might also want to discuss which is around "JHipster/Stackery for OSGi". Find this idea in the git history of this document. Given the long timespan and new people we might not go into details this time.

##  Notes for discussion

Here comes some more explanation on the topics above. Those may be the foundation of a discussion.

### on 2.
We particularly answered this before. We only should add new voices to this statement to stay in the time box ;)
Our recent conclusions on this:
- The problem (complexity) is real and the modularity is a well respected solution.
- We found that OSGi has a bad public image as being overly complex by itself (various random discussions on the internet). Mostly uninformed.
- We found that the OSGi Alliance by itself acts quite defensely, walled garden-style which is not necessarily a modern style for building communities (is this a goal at all? probably not)

## Things to decide if possible in the last 10mins

- shall we do this type of calls regularly (bi-weekly? monthly?)
- What can be the output of greendev? This of cause is a teaser that will not be solved in this call.
  - software? (probably not since participants are already involved in their on groups for this)
  - curated overview of osgi solutions (since information on the web is spread around, full of outdated advice at times) ?
  - a well mantained, independent beginners guide which also quickly shows where OSGi shines and where its just not a good fit ?
  - a manifest for "modular monolith" ? 
  - Just keep being it a "modularity interest with osgi fetish" slack channel?
