# Next Hangout Topics

Maybe as early as Wednesday, 24th of July 2019

> I think we need to discuss options around JHipster/Stackery for OSGi. I am discussing this with @Thomas Driessen and i am personally torn between „just a code generator, isn’t this just for tech demos?“ and „yes, that’s a way to give people the batteries to fly immediately and learn on the go“.

## Existing examples 

- [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) (generates a working, opinionated CRUD app out of a domain model (textual/visual), i.e. Spring Boot/Dropwizard on steroids)
- [Stackery](https://www.stackery.io/) (generates an AWS Cloudformation stack yaml out of a visual description of a serverless app. For functions: also generation of project structure for different runtimes. Also manages CI/CD/Monitoring of generated stacks)
- [Dropwizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/1.3.13/docs/) / [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) (generate opinionated, walking skeletons (CLI?))

## Old examples
The "generate working projects" is not new at all. Lets mention some old examples (for good or bad):

- Ruby On Rails (I remember OSGI Enroute - at an early face - had ROR for OSGi as its goal)

## Possible Contexts for a generator

- Generator for OSGi applications
- Generator for yet to be defined, revolutionary new framework (OSGi but without the hassle ;))
