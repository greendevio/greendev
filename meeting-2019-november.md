# November Hangout Topics

Most likely on the evening of november 6th, according to doodle https://doodle.com/poll/byinp3453qdm3chp

Hangout Link: TBD

There are quite some reasons to have a call again:
- very long time since the last hangout (July if i remember correctly)
- many new people arrived
- the OSGi community event has taken place

## Propsal for agenda (total time hopefully around 60mins)
1. Quick introduction round
2. Initial GreenDev question asked was, here in german: "OSGi, is das noch frisch, oder kann das Weg"? - loosly translated as "OSGi: is this still fresh or can it go to trash?"
3. There has been some activity outside of OSGi Specs recently. Maybe we can quickly pitch one or two for inspiration?
- JBs Whinegrower
- Tonis Febo/Golemites
4. There where older ideas that we might also want to discuss which is around "JHipster/Stackery for OSGi". Find this idea in the git history of this document. Given the long timespan and new people we might not go into details this time.


##  Notes for discussion

Here comes some more explanation on the topics above. Those may be the foundation of a discussion.

### on 2.
We particularly answered this before. We only should add new voices to this statement to stay in the time box ;)
Our recent conclusions on this:
- The problem (complexity) is real and the modularity is a well respected solution.
- We found that OSGi has a bad public image as being overly complex by itself (various random discussions on the internet). Mostly uninformed.
- We found that the OSGi Alliance by itself acts quite defensely, walled garden-style which is not necessarily a modern style for building communities (is this a goal at all? probably not)
